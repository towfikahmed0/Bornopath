**BornoPath** is a free and open-source platform created by **Towfik Ahmed** to make English vocabulary learning simpler, smarter, and rooted in the learner’s language and culture.

The name blends two Bangla words — **“Borno”** (letter) and **“Path”** (lesson) — reflecting our mission: to guide learners along a clear and confident path through the world of words.

We believe learning vocabulary doesn’t have to be overwhelming. BornoPath offers a clean, distraction-free environment where you can build your word power through daily practice, interactive tools, and progress tracking — all designed to support meaningful and consistent growth.

This is just the beginning. **BornoPath is a work in progress** — shaped by curiosity, driven by passion, and open to change with every step.

> Learn a little every day.  
> Let your words grow — with **BornoPath**.
